      <span className="text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-300">
        Well, writing Content has become my hobbie ever since I joined College.
        I write blogs on Life, Coding, Experinences, Personal Growth and growing
        tech world. I am a good observer and I keep a tight eye on events around
        me and on Social Media and then try to take out some learning from it.

      <span className="text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-300">
        Well this is the place where I keep writing and show and hone my writing
        skills. To actually meet the writer inside me, I pick up and a Pen & a
        Paper and then make the pen my sword as my keyboard is for me while
        codingüòÅ.
      </span>

      <span className="text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-300">
        Well, I also try to give life to my writings by adding my voice and
        B-Rolls. I keep posting such content on my instagram cause I love doing
        this. And become someone who puts good message to this youth and inspire
        someone like me who feels like changing something for himself and world.
